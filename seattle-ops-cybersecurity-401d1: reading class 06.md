The CIA triad is what governs the work of cybersecurity professionals. Confidentiality refers to the security of the information -- namely 
ensuring that it is not exposed or left open to theft due to security weaknesses. Integrity pertains to the purity of the data; in other 
words, is the data the same as it is transported from one place to another, or is it the same even as it remains in one place? Availability 
is the assurance that data is backed up and that it will be available when it is requested.

All of these are affected by the security of data at rest or in transit. To this end, encryption plays a major role in the implementation
of safety measures. Encryption makes data unreadable as long as the underlying process for doing so is sound. In addition to encryption, 
hashing is useful for verifying the integrity of data which has been transmitted. Some of the common hashes are MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256. 
All of these will show, when compared to the hash before transit, if a file has been tampered with during transit.
