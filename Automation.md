In the modern age of cybersecurity, the number of threats (let alone the persistence of them) is so great that the only means of dealing with them in real time is through automation. According to AT&T, there are at least 7 very important reasons to put automation to work for you:

1. User interaction with malicious sites. With automation, the firewall could be automatically updated to block the malicious site immediately once it is detected.
2. Limiting damage: when malware is detected on the network, the automated incident response tools can go to work by isolating the affected area.
3. Gather information about the scope of the breach: log management is very important for understanding what happened. As important, is having the capability to filter and search those logs.
4. Block interaction with a C2 server: Automation can detect a connection with a Command and Control server and move directly into blocking that server from communicating with any device on the network.
5. New ransomware: With automated IR, the network can be automatically updated with the latest detection rules once any new malware becomes known.
6. Making sure resources are used productively: with different teams working on IR it is possible that a breach falls through the cracks and is not addressed, or the opposite, and multiple resources work on the same thing. With automated ticketing, this could be addressed efficiently to make sure resources are allocated correctly.
7. Protection at all hours: rules can be put in place that would affect some sort of action in the event that a person is unavailable to perform this action. If an automatic action is not possible, email and text notifications can be set up.
