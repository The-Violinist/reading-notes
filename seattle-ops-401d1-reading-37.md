ZAP, or zed attack proxy is a tool for testing, or what they call discovery and attempted 
exploration of vulnerabilities. This tool is used as part of the pentesting process, which 
is broken down into exploring, attacking, and reporting. This is accomplished by being a 
man-in-the-middle, or proxy between a browser and any other web based source.

Within ZAP there are many tools which help with each aspect of pentesting. A main starting 
point is the quick start which allows the cyber security analysts to run an automated scam 
against a page or a whole site. The same thing can be done in a more hands on approach with 
the manual explore scan. And with the ZAP marketplace, this tool is customizable and  quite 
extensible.
