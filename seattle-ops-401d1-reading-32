In order to defend against and try to recover from malware it is necessary to understand how it 
works. This is where malware analysis comes in. The main objectives of this analysis are to 
generally breakdown the malware in order to investigate its characteristics, understand its 
functionality, discover its origin, and make an attempt at predicting its impact. In order to perform 
these tasks, one must have a live version of the malware to work with. 

There are 4 main ways to conduct the analysis:
Static: looking at metadata and other assets in order to create an IOC.
Dynamic: observe the behavior of the malware to make some determinations as to how it interacts with 
  the target device and the network.
Manual: take the code apart using debuggers, decompilers, and decrypters in order to understand the 
  logic behind the code.
Automated: while this might not provide insights into the code, it can give detailed reports and 
  provide data for an incident response system.

The general steps to analyzing malware include observation, disassembly, and memory analysis. This 
last one is very challenging, but there are tools such as Memoryze which can help with finding running 
processes as well as verifying drivers and driver signatures. While this is a field that lacks personnel, 
the work can be intensive and requires a great degree of skill in coding and analysis.
