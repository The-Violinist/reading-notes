Mimikatz is an open source program which was developed by Benjamin Delpy when he wanted 
to demonstrate to Microsoft how weak their authentication protocols were. While it is a tool
which can be used by attackers, this is a tools which is commonplace amongst pentesters. 
Mimikatz was first developed to demonstrate one vulnerability, it has been continually 
updated and can perform many common pentesting taks, including:

Pass-the-Hash: Obtain the master administrator NTLM hash and use that to authenticate as the 
administrator without a password.

Pass-the-Ticket: Similar to passing the hash, password data is now stored as a ‘ticket’ and 
is performed in much the same way as pass-the-hash.

Over-pass the Hash: This is again similar, but with the nuance of impersonating a user from 
the domain.

Kerberos Golden Ticket: Obtains the ticket for the KRBTGT account which encrypts all other 
tickets. This gives admin credentials to any computer on the network.

Kerberos Silver Ticket: Obtains a TGS ticket which makes it possible to use services on the 
network.

Pass-the-Cache: Basically the same as pass the ticket but which uses encrypted login data from 
a Linux or UNIX system.
