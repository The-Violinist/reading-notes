YARA rules are 1 way of helping to close the gap on system and network vulnerabilities. This is done by creating rules targeted at a specific attack, whether that is through the code itself or the social engineering that is associated with that attack. These rules are written in a variation of C# which was created by Victor Alvarez. He said the name comes from either YARA: Another Recursive Acronym or Yet Another Ridiculous Acronym.

Because threat actors are constantly changing their TTPs so as to not bore their audience, we as the cybersecurity professionals must adapt and update our identification, and therefore detection, of these means. YARA rules can be created for use with many different AV software options and updates to these rules are constantly being rolled out to keep up with the needs of the security industry.
