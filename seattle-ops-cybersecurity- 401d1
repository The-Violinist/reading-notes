Public key infrastructure is a means by which the identity of a user or 
device can be certified. Authentication through certification is not 
limited to users and devices, but can also be used for     programs, 
processes, and components. A certificate authority is an entity which 
digitally signs the documents and creates a certificate.

PKI technology uses public key encryption; this is a method of encryption 
in which there are a pair of keys which are used to encrypt and decrypt. 
Most public key encryption uses the X.509v3 standard, a machine-readable 
certificate format. The common uses of PKE are with HTTPS and the underlying 
SSL and TLS. This secures websites and reduces the possibility of man-in-
the-middle attacks.
