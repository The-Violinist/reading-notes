Malware analysis is a vital field which helps to provide detections and thus enhanced monitoring 
and protection of computers and networks. One of the starting points is to statically look at an 
executable and make some determinations about it based upon certain characteristics. A 
leading tool which is used to do this is PeStudio. This tool provides analysis of suspected files 
as well as retrieves data from virustotal.com. The analysis includes compiles a list of indicators 
which could signal that a file is malicious. Identifying blacklisted functions and strings, use of 
libraries, content of headers, as well as checking for digital certificates are some of the major 
items which are analyzed by PeStudio.

Another powerful tool which is used by a malware analyst is the NSA’s Ghidra. This is a decompiler 
which is able to reverse engineer code in order to study what is actually happening in the code of 
a compiled file. Ghidra is software which was developed by the NSA but which has now been made 
available to the public in an attempt to make analysis of malware more widespread. Ghidra comes 
equipped with many tools to breakdown and identify the parts of code which make up a given malware 
file.
