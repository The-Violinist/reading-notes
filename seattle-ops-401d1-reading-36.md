Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability wherein an attacker can manipulate interactions 
with a webserver in order to compromise data. This is done in 3 main ways -- Reflected, Stored, 
and DOM. Below are descriptions of the 2 more common tactics:

-- Reflected XSS: The use of scripts in data input fields to bring about immediate interactions 
with the server in an unsafe manner.

-- Stored XSS: An attacker is able to upload scripts/data to a webserver in order for it to be 
used at a later time in multiple connections. Also known as persistent XSS. These scripts are 
then called in later interactions with the server in order to compromise the confidentiality of 
data.

The main reasons for cross site scripting is to either impersonate another user in order to 
steal data (passwords and PII), disruption to a site, or to inject malware into a site. The 
good news is that most vulnerabilities are easily found with scanning tools. One of the common 
tools for this work is Burp Suite. Through testing of input to every field of a website 
determinations can be quickly made as to the security of the site. In addition, preventive 
measures include: filtering input, encoding output, and using correct response headers.
