A penetration test is a simulated attack against a computer system or network with the goal of 
finding vulnerabilities. This can then in turn lead to hardening the defenses to better protect the 
network. Pentesting is broken into 5 stages:

Reconnaissance: this includes defining the goals of the test and then gathering information about 
  the target in order to begin to isolate possible vulnerabilities.
  
Scanning: there are 2 main types. Static Analysis is the inspection of code in order to pinpoint 
  vulnerability while Dynamic Analysis is running the code and observing in real time the performance 
  of an application.

Gaining Access: Uses attacks such as XSS, SQLi, or known backdoors in order to access the system. 
  This is usually followed by escalating privilege in order to steal data and act as a man in the 
  middle.

Maintaining Access: any APT has as its end goal creating the most damage, exfiltrating the most 
  data, or extorting the most money. In recreating this with a pentest, it is important to attempt 
  to maintain access to find weaknesses in the IDS/IPS system. To make this happen, it is necessary 
  to maintain a persistent presence. This is done through evasion and covering tracks (removing or 
  sanitizing logs).

Analysis (and post-test configuration): The outcome is hardening the system. This is accomplished 
  by documenting each step and finding solutions to defenses and tailoring the IPS and SIEM systems 
  to detect whatever means were used to exploit the system.
