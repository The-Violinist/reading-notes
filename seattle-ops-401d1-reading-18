Threat modeling is a technique which can be applied to anything from software to networks, to 
IoT. The relative risk and severity depends upon many factors including the assetâ€™s value, its 
level of communication with the outside world and many other factors. A general threat model 
is dependent upon the design of the item being adjudicated, and includes potential threats, 
actions taken for each threat, and a way of validating the success of actions taken.

The reasons for creating a threat model include, but are not limited to:
  Secure network design
  Good use of resources
  Dev Ops
  Compliance
  Balancing of controls and usability in light of risks
  Documentation
  Ensure the health of the business in the face of cyber attack

The 4 main questions which a threat model seeks to answer are:
  What are we working on?
  What can go wrong?
  What will we do with the findings?
  Did we do a good job?

In the world of cybersecurity, threat modeling has made a major shift towards an agile mindset, 
and as such, should play a role in the consideration of any RFC.
