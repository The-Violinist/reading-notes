In cyber security one could say that there is a dividing line which is creating at the point of 
a completed attack. Everything up to and including the aftermath of an attack is within the purview 
of strictly cybersecurity professionals. However, what happens after the fact with the evidence, 
and more importantly, creating a better tomorrow? This is where the field of cyber (and computer) 
forensics comes in.

Cyber forensics is the reactionary field of analysis which attempts to gather the breadcrumbs which 
are left behind by an attack in order to analyze what happened. This is done to create better 
prevention through discovery of the process of an attack and to facilitate recovery of data, if 
possible. There are 6 stages of forensics investigation: Readiness, Evaluation, Collection, Analysis, 
Presentation, Review. 

While the roles of cyber forensics jobs are very similar (and have much overlap), there are a 
plethora of job titles. These include: Information Security Crime Investigator, Computer Forensics 
Engineer, Digital Forensics, Computer Forensics, Cyber Forensics, Computer Forensics Technician, and 
the list goes on. The bottom line: this is a field which is in great need of talent as the 
responsibilities stretch from conducting breach investigations to compiling data for legal cases.
