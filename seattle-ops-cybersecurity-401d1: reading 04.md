In this modern age of everything going electronic and to the cloud, managing logins can be a 
bit of a headache. A solution to this is to create a scenario where an individual has a single 
digital identity. This is called identity and access management. With IAM, when a user is 
logged into a system, they then have access to any federated system.

In an enterprise environment, this can be particularly useful for managing user identities 
across multiple platforms in a comprehensive way — especially useful for onboarding/off 
boarding of employees — as well as in keeping with company policies and government regulations. 

In recent years, with the push towards cloud environments, there is no longer a boundary 
around the network as a user is logging in remotely. This creates an even greater need for 
SSO in order to not only protect the system but also make the federated systems accessible 
quickly, and without additional sign ins.
