DLP — or data loss prevention — seeks to protect data from being exfiltrated, lost, or 
rendered inaccessible. Data loss is possible through the transmission of data, whether 
accidental or intentionally. The main reasons for implementing DLP are: compliance 
(personal information, safety), protection of intellectual property, and data visibility 
(seeing how employees use data).

There are many trends that are driving a push for DLP. These include:
  Greater (quantity and size) data breaches

  Increasing compliance regulations

  More diverse work zones

  Concern over consequences (monetarily and reputation) of data loss

  Shortage of security personnel

When determining appropriate measures it is important to realize that it is not only a 
security consideration. In order to make a case for implementation of DLP measures one 
must carefully analyze how the data is used and what the main portion points are. 
Consider how this will help the organization as a whole. Because this is a larger 
organizational endeavor, it is important to involve the necessary people and have 
clearly defined roles.
