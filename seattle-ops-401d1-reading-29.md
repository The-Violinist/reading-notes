What is threat hunting? While this is an often misunderstood field, the name really 
says it all. It is a proactive activity of searching out intrusions in every part of 
a network. More importantly, it is a never ending process of searching out possible 
threats. This is a change from the old model of either detecting intrusions that have 
already happened or trying to block intrusions at the gate via firewall or antivirus.

The basis of threat hunting is the assumption that an intrusion has already occurred 
but is as of yet undetected. One of the means of doing this is through log analysis. 
Through analysis and correlation of logs within the entire network it becomes possible 
to detect unusual behaviors which could warrant further inspection.

Studies show that the average APT is active for six months in a network before it is 
detected. Furthermore, it is not through any action of the compromised organization 
that the attack is detected, but rather through third parties such as banks or credit 
companies. This is the reason that threat hunting is a necessity in the modern age of 
cyber security in order to assure that companies are doing their due diligence to 
protect their data and the data of others.
