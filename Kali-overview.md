Kali Linux is a debian-based distribution which is used extensively for cyber security purposes. This is due to the fact that it has many built in tools (over 600 to be specific) for just this purpose. It is, and always will be, a free distribution which is open source; at the same time it is very secure as well, being overseen by a small group of people trusted to commit using multiple secure protocols. Kali can be easily adapted to fit specific needs and it has support for multiple languages.

One of the built in tools is Metasploit. This is a very powerful tool which has over 500 payloads (pared down from 1500). Originally written in perl in 2003 with 11 exploits, it has gone through some variations over the years and is now the robust tool it is today, powered by Ruby. Because of itâ€™s prevalence, there is very good documentation as well as learning resources and tutorials dedicated to Kali.
