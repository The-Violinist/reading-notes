Web apps are commonplace these days, but the security of them is a constant concern. There 
are  many vulnerabilities which are present in a web app environment which leads to a need for 
detection of such weaknesses before they are exploited. That is where BUrp Suite comes in. This 
is a massive multi faceted suite of tools created for pentesting web apps. It is a proxy-based 
tool which can be configured to intercept traffic from multiple domains.

Included in the many tools are the intruder (which is able to use a variety of payloads against 
a source), the repeater (used for making changes to request in order to see side-by-side what the 
results would be), the sequencer (which analyzes for randomness), and a decoder (which candy code 
range of standards). While there are included community written extensions, Burp Suite is a 
subscription-based software which has plans for both a regular professional license and for 
enterprise use.
