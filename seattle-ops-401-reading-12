The mainstays of network security include many different devices and software in order 
to close vulnerabilities, block intrusions and monitor access. One such method is the 
use of a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). With this, it is possible to monitor 
all of the pathways within a network. This is done thru the detection of anomalous behavior.

The benefits of NIDS include monitoring of transmissions in real time, monitor content 
of data, look at data in the context of the protocol, provides means of analysis based 
on the type and frequency of attacks, and aid in compliance through logging. With all 
the benefits which are provided, it is necessary to have an experienced tech administer
a NIDS. the drawbacks are: it cannot prevent attacks, cannot process encrypted data, 
and produces many false positives. However, if security is a concern, an IDS is a good 
addition to the suite of security tools.
