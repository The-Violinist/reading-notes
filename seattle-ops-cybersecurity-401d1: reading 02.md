A Security Operations Center (or SOC) is a centralized team, generally on site, which protects a company from cyber security threats through analysis of, 
and reaction to those threats. This team works closely with both the development and IT teams. The SOC is responsible for  monitoring all devices on a 
network and subsequently identifying threats and responding to incidents as they occur. In addition to (or instead of) a SOC, some companies have a computer 
security incident response team. This team fulfills many of the same roles, but they also interact with clients, execs, and the board. Because of overlap, 
there is a push by some to merge the 2.

Some of the responsibilities of a SOC include using monitoring tools, investigating suspicious activity, and responding to security incidents. Depending on 
the size of a company, the following roles might be present in the SOC: Director of Incident Response, CISO, SOC Manager, Security Engineer, and Security 
Analyst. Some of the benefits of a SOC include timely response to incidents and reducing cybersecurity costs.

One of the tools which might be employed for the purpose of constant monitoring is Nagios. This is an open source product which provides monitoring of 
networked devices. This includes, at a basic level, whether or not devices are up or down. It can monitor network services such as HTTP, SMTP, and SSH as 
well as host resources such as processor load, disk usage and operating systems. Through constant monitoring, Nagios is able to send email and text 
notifications regarding any level of issue that it can detect.
