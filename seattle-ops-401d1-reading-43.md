The video today describes evasion techniques for pentesters in order to not be detected by IDS and firewall systems. 
Some of the techniques include what is called ‘low and slow’ (performing scans at a slow rate), fragmenting of requests 
in order to not trigger alarms, and spoofing to send requests from authenticated sources. Other techniques are rate 
throttling, and using decoys to mask your movements. The other article gives a brief description of sniffing. There are 
2 types of sniffing: Active and Passive. Active sniffing uses a switch as a point to intercept the traffic which is 
intended for specific MAC addresses. Passive is simply capturing data as it is being sent across the LAN from one 
endpoint to another.
