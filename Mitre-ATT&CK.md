The Mitre ATT&CK framework is a common knowledge base compiled from observations of millions of cyber attacks. The goal of this compendium is to classify and detail how cyber attacks take place and to clearly distill the techniques used. The acronym stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge. The idea behind this, stems from the need for a good security team.

When it comes to a red team, the tools which are used are just as important as the people using them. There are 3 main approaches:

1. Build your own tools
2. Hire an MSSP to monitor your network
3. Acquire a collection of paid and open source tools

By classifying the components of an attack it is then possible to begin to make determinations about appropriate actions for mediation as well as future monitoring and defense. The framework is broken up into 5 parts:

1. pre-attack  or defense preparedness
2. Windows tools
3. Linux tools
4. macOS tools
5. Mobile

As the world of cyber security and the threats are constantly changing, the ATT&CK framework is consistently evolving to meet the needs of the cyber security professional.
