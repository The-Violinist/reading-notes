There are 2 states for data: at rest and in transit. One of the most common ways in which 
to preserve the confidentiality of the data is to use encryption. The risk profiles for 
data, whether in transit or at rest, vary somewhat but encryption is an effective tool 
in any case. 

In addition to encryption, it is important to to have good network security which will 
help to reduce the vulnerability of data at rest. Some good practices for data in transit 
include: automatic encryption, categorizing/classifying data to ensure appropriate 
security measures are taken, blocking/prompting users when accessing email attachments.
