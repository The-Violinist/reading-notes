What is the purpose of an audit? To determine the overall health and ability to provide the CIA
triad for the organization. An audit will show areas of weakness which need to be addressed in 
order for there to be the best possible coverage of a network.

What exactly does an audit cover? There are 4 main areas that an audit looks at:

1. Privilege auditing: do people have permissions they need and, conversely, do others have permission 
they should not have?

2. Usage auditing: are resources being used as they should be? This ensures security for systems and 
applications.

3. Escalation auditing: will disaster recovery plans work? Will the right person be available to be
contacted when needed? Will the plans set to be implemented be sufficient to provide a full recover?

4. Administrative Auditing: Is documentation being done properly?

Some of the main standards for auditing include:
ISO Compliance
  Information asset security
HIPAA Security Rule
  Patient confidentiality
PCI DSS Compliance
  Credit Card security
SOX Compliance
  Investor protection

The bottom line is to set in place policies which will protect network systems. When that fails (due 
to a cyber attack) assure that there is sufficient protection to ensure backup and recovery. In order 
to put this in place, have clearly set roles which will oversee the implementation and monitoring of 
network systems.
